# StealthNote

StealthNote is a platform to anonymously post messages while proving you belong to an organization -
without revealing who you are.

We use [Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) to prove that you have a valid Google Workspace account from your organization, while keeping your email address and other details private.

The messages you post cannot be &quot;provably&quot; linked to you.

Try it out at [stealthnote.xyz](https://stealthnote.xyz).
